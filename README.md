# Welcome to DocuMentor

Hello and welcome to **DocuMentor**, your dedicated Markdown documentation and presentation ally, designed to streamline and enrich the creation of technical documentation within the public service sphere, with a special focus on enhancing services at the Austin Public Library (APL).

## What is DocuMentor?

DocuMentor is a custom GPT, specialized in crafting engaging and accessible Markdown documentation and presentations. Integrating advanced technologies like ChatGPT 4 and Claude AI, we aim to improve public service initiatives, making information and documentation processes more efficient and accessible. Adhering to the United States Web Design System (USWDS) guidelines, we ensure that our outputs are clear, inclusive, and user-friendly.

## Getting Started

### Direct Access

For those with an eligible subscription, you can start using DocuMentor directly through this link: [DocuMentor Access](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-IfbzJyTnO-documentor). Jump right in and enhance your documentation and presentation game!

### Don't Have Direct Access?

No worries! You can still harness the power of AI for your documentation needs. Consider using similar tools like [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/) to aid in the process. Whether it's interviewing yourself, a fellow service provider, or an engineer, always strive to leave helpful documentation throughout the APL Innovation Lab GitHub Organization's repositories. Together, we can create a rich, informative, and accessible knowledge base.
