# USWDS Design Principles

This repository contains the design principles of the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) in a convenient CSV format. The USWDS is a design system developed by the U.S. government to help create consistent, accessible, and responsive digital experiences across federal agencies.

These design principles provide guidance on how to create user-centered, efficient, and effective digital services. They emphasize understanding user needs, reducing complexity, designing for accessibility, promoting consistency, iterating based on feedback, using data to drive decisions, showcasing benefits, reusing existing solutions, maintaining a design system, and starting small while being aspirational.

## CSV Data

You can find the USWDS Design Principles data in the following CSV format:

```csv
Principle,Description
Start with real user needs,"Work to understand the different points of view of your key stakeholders, including end users and internal teams that support the service."
Do less,"Reduce the complexity of your service. Minimize distractions and clutter so users can navigate easily and accomplish their goals."
Design with accessibility in mind,"Create a service that can be used by all people, including those with disabilities. In addition to complying with standards, continuously test for accessibility issues."
Promote continuity,"Align new and existing services, both online and offline, to create a consistent and unified experience for all users."
Listen, research, test, and iterate,"Continuously improve your service by listening to users, researching best practices, testing solutions, and iterating based on feedback."
Use data to drive decisions,"Collect and analyze data to better understand your users and their needs. Use this information to make informed decisions about your service."
Showcase benefits for agency and users,"Highlight the value of your service for both your agency and your users. This helps justify the investment and demonstrates the positive impact of your work."
Reuse, reuse, reuse,"Leverage existing solutions, designs, and code to save time and resources. Reusing proven elements also promotes consistency and familiarity for users."
Rigorously maintain your design system,"Regularly update and maintain your design system to ensure it remains relevant, useful, and effective. This helps ensure consistency and quality over time."
Be aspirational, but start small,"Set ambitious goals for your service, but start with a manageable scope. Incrementally build and improve your service over time, learning and adapting as you go."
```

To use this data, simply copy and paste the CSV content into a file with a `.csv` extension. You can then open and edit the file using spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
